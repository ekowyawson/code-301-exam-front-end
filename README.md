# Retro Class 14

Reflecting on the third week of my Code 301 class here at Code Fellows, it's important to consolidate the key experiences and learnings:

1. **What Went Well**:
   - Successful Debugging: I effectively debugged a complex full-stack MERN application. This included identifying and resolving issues related to API interactions and React component states.
   - Enhanced Understanding of React: My proficiency with React hooks and component-based architecture improved significantly. The practical application of `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` went particularly well.
   - Collaboration: Working with peers provided valuable insights and different perspectives on problem-solving.

2. **What I Learned Today**:
   - Backend-frontend Integration: I gained a deeper understanding of how the backend API interacts with the frontend in a MERN application.
   - Error Handling: Learned more about handling errors in API calls and the importance of robust error handling for a better user experience.
   - Importance of Environment Variables: I realized how crucial it is to manage environment variables correctly for application functionality.

3. **What I Should Do Differently Next Time**:
   - More Comments: I should add more comments to my code for better readability and ease of maintenance.
   - Test-Driven Development: Incorporating more testing, possibly adopting a test-driven development approach, to catch bugs early and ensure code reliability.

4. **What Still Puzzles Me or Needs More Learning**:
   - Asynchronous JavaScript: While I have improved, I still find managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript challenging.
   - Advanced State Management: Understanding more complex state management patterns in React, possibly exploring contexts or state management libraries like Redux.
   - Optimization: Learning more about optimizing React applications for performance, especially in the context of larger, more complex applications.

This week has been a blend of challenges and achievements, providing a rich learning experience that has significantly enhanced my full-stack development skills. The insights gained this week will be invaluable for my future projects and professional development.
